## Community built snapps 

- [Mina Secret Exchange](https://mina.proxylabs.org/) - The secret exchange allows users to buy imaginary tokens after successfully providing the solution to a series of math problems while keeping the solution itself secure and private, not exposing it to the network.
- [Blind Man's Bluff](https://github.com/wotomas/BlindMansBluff#build--run) - A simplified version of poker where zk-SNARKs keep the contract unaware of the actual numbers users have, yet giving it the knowledge of the game result.
- [Snapp Hangman](https://github.com/frisitano/snapp-hangman) - With Mina's SnarkyJS API and SnarkyJS library showing their zero-knowledge capabilities, this is a snapp Hangman game utilizing zk-SNARKs to keep the secret word and random input private.

You can find more information and links to the code in this snapps directory thatâ€™s built by the community: https://snappsformina.com. Add your Snapp using this link: https://snappsformina.com/submit-a-snapp. We'd love to see what everyone is building!
